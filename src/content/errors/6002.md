# NG6002

`NG6002` is a compiler error that indicates problems with imports. It is aliased as `NGMODULE_INVALID_IMPORT` in the `ErrorCode`s enum.

### Error information

```text
This import contains errors, which may affect components that depend on this NgModule.
```

```text
Appears in the NgModule.imports of AppModule, but could not be resolved to an NgModule class
```

### Potential causes and solutions

#### `ngcc`
Angular 9, the first Ivy release, had several problems parsing packages through `ngcc`: path mappings, tsconfig issues, and more. If you are on Angular 9, update to at least 10 or the latest minor. If you are on other later versions, this is not the problem.

#### Webpack dev server
In some cases Webpack will fail to reload entire files - when switching branches while running, for example. Restarting the server fixes this and is always worth a try.

#### Importing a non-module
In Angular 13 and below, before standalone components, placing a component, directive, or pipe in the `imports` array of a module would produce the second message listed above:
```text
Appears in the NgModule.imports of AppModule, but could not be resolved to an NgModule class
```
To fix it, replace the imported trait with the `NgModule` where it's declared:

```diff
-  imports: [MatButton],
+  imports: [MatButtonModule],
```
Another common occurrence of this is placing a trait we want to declare in the `imports` array instead; here the solution is to move it to the `declarations`:
```
-  imports: [MyComponent],
+  declarations: [MyComponent],
```
In Angular 14 and above, the error is replaced with a more obvious one:
```text
The component 'MatButton' appears in 'imports', but is not standalone and cannot be imported directly. It must be imported via an NgModule.`
```

#### Importing a module with errors
Trying to import another module with its own set of errors will throw the first error listed here. This one can be hard to debug, but the best way to narrow it down is to look at the identified module for issues. According to [this open issue](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50792), it's commonly run into when updating from older versions which can point at outdated dependencies. Check for packages that may not be compatible with your updated version and update or remove them.
